# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

## About

Good day, My name is Benita! I studied Political Science and I am an entry level data analyst. I recently completed a data analytics job simulation internship with Deloitte involving data analysis and forensic technology. I have been actively working on personal projects that demonstrate my skills and knowledge in data analysis. These projects have not only honed my technical skills but also given me a unique perspective on how data can be used to drive business outcomes.

Throughout my course, I developed a strong proficiency in working with complex dataset, uncovering insights through pattern and trend recognition, and mastering data manipulation, visualization, analysis techniques, including data cleaning, transformation, and database management, as well as programming languages, which I am confident will serve as a strong foundation in my data specialist role.

Outside of my professional responsibilities, I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest data analysis tools and methodologies, and I actively seek out opportunities to broaden my expertise. I thrive in collaborative and independent environments, fueled by the excitement of uncovering hidden insights and the fulfillment of leveraging data to tackle intricate challenges.
